      The croissant, often mistaken as a purely French invention, actually has
      roots that trace back to Austria. Its ancestor, the kipferl—a
      crescent-shaped pastry enjoyed in Vienna since the 13th century—was said
      to have been baked in celebration of Austria’s victory over the Ottoman
      Empire during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The story gets juicier in the
      19th century, when Austrian entrepreneur August Zang opened a Viennese
      bakery in Paris, introducing the kipferl to French tastebuds. Ever the
      culinary artists, French bakers gave it a makeover with their signature
      puff pastry, birthing the buttery, flaky icon we now worship at breakfast.
      So while Austria gave us the shape and spirit, it was France that added
      the finesse—transforming a humble pastry into a global symbol of
      indulgence and elegance.
